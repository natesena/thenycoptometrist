# Book Now Button Conversion Optimization - PRD

**Epic:** Book Now Button Conversion Optimization
**Branch:** feature/book-now-improvement
**Created:** 2025-10-18
**Type:** Epic
**Priority:** 0 (Highest - directly impacts conversion goals)

---

## Problem Statement

Current navigation provides a single Book Now button, but doesn't prioritize the most effective conversion paths or provide alternative contact methods. We're missing opportunities to convert visitors who prefer different booking/contact methods, and we're not tracking which conversion methods are most effective.

The current implementation:
- Only shows a single "Book Now" button
- Doesn't provide clear alternatives (call, email)
- Lacks comprehensive event tracking for conversion optimization
- Missing enumerated event types in Prisma schema

---

## Goals & Objectives

1. **Maximize conversion rate** by presenting all contact methods in priority order
2. **Prioritize ZocDoc bookings** as primary conversion path
3. **Provide fallback options** (Call, Email) for users who prefer other contact methods
4. **Track all conversion events** to understand which methods drive the most bookings
5. **Create consistent, optimized experience** across mobile and desktop
6. **Establish data-driven optimization** through comprehensive metrics

## User Stories

### As a Potential Patient (Mobile)
> I want to see all booking/contact options in a convenient drawer so I can choose my preferred method to connect with Dr. Latek.

**Acceptance:**
- Tap a button to open drawer with all options
- Options are clearly labeled and prioritized
- Drawer is easy to dismiss
- Works on all mobile screen sizes

### As a Potential Patient (Desktop)
> I want a transparent header that's visually appealing and doesn't obscure the beautiful page content while still providing easy access to booking.

**Acceptance:**
- Header is transparent with readable white text
- Navigation remains accessible and clear
- Conversion options are prominent

### As a Product Owner
> I want to track all conversion events so I can optimize the booking funnel and understand which methods drive the most patient bookings.

**Acceptance:**
- All click events are tracked in metrics database
- Can generate reports on conversion funnel performance
- Can identify which channels drive most bookings

### As a Developer
> I want well-defined event types in Prisma so tracking is consistent, type-safe, and maintainable.

**Acceptance:**
- Event types are enumerated in Prisma schema
- TypeScript provides autocomplete for event types
- No magic strings in tracking code

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Navigation & UI Components

1. **Mobile UI Component**
   - Implement drawer component for conversion options
   - Test two variants: left-slide drawer vs. top-slide drawer
   - Drawer should contain all conversion options in priority order
   - Drawer should be dismissible via overlay click or close button
   - Smooth animation on open/close

2. **Desktop UI Component**
   - Transparent header background
   - White text for all navigation items
   - Maintain readability across all page backgrounds
   - Hover states for interactive elements

3. **Conversion Priority Order**
   - **Primary:** Book Now → ZocDoc
   - **Secondary:** Call
   - **Tertiary:** Email

#### Contact Information

- **ZocDoc Link:** `https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/joanna-latek-od-640237`
- **Phone:** `+1 (212) 228-0950`
- **Email:** `info@thenycoptometrist.com`

#### Event Tracking

4. **Prisma Schema Updates**
   - Create enumerated event types (no magic strings)
   - Update MetricsEvent model to use enum
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing data

5. **Event Types to Track**

**Conversion Events (Highest Priority):**
- `book_now_clicked` - ZocDoc booking link clicked
- `phone_clicked` - Phone number/call button clicked
- `email_clicked` - Email link clicked

**Engagement Events:**
- `social_media_clicked` - Social media icon/link clicked
- `product_referral_clicked` - Product recommendation link clicked
- `blog_post_clicked` - Navigation to blog post from homepage
- `external_link_clicked` - Any external link clicked

**Navigation Events (Already tracked):**
- `visit` - Page view (already implemented)

6. **Tracking Implementation**
   - All conversion buttons must call `trackClick()` with proper event type
   - Include additional context data (button location, page, etc.)
   - Graceful degradation if tracking fails
   - No blocking of user interaction while tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Mobile drawer animation should be 60fps
- Event tracking should not degrade page performance
- Analytics should handle offline/failed requests gracefully
- No blocking network requests for analytics

#### Accessibility
- Mobile drawer must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Keyboard navigation support for drawer
- Screen reader announcements for drawer state
- Focus management when drawer opens/closes
- High contrast mode support
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px

#### Browser Support
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Mobile Safari (iOS 14+)
- Chrome Mobile (Android 10+)

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile: 320px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+

## Design Considerations

### Mobile Drawer Design

**Two Variants to A/B Test:**

1. **Left-slide drawer** (Sheet from left edge)
   - Pros: Thumb-friendly on right-handed users
   - Cons: May conflict with browser back gesture

2. **Top-slide drawer** (Sheet from top)
   - Pros: No gesture conflicts, natural dropdown pattern
   - Cons: May require two-handed operation

**Drawer Content:**
- Clear heading: "Schedule Your Appointment"
- Visual hierarchy emphasizing Book Now
- Icons for each option (calendar, phone, email)
- Brief description under each option

### Desktop Header Design

**Transparent Header Requirements:**
- Background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` or similar
- Text: White (`#FFFFFF`)
- Backdrop filter for readability (optional)
- Sticky/fixed positioning
- Smooth scroll behavior

**Visual Considerations:**
- Maintain brand colors (federalBlue, etc.) for CTAs
- Ensure proper z-index layering
- Drop shadow or subtle border for depth
- Hover effects should be subtle but clear

### Component Architecture

```
components/
├── ConversionDrawer.tsx          # Mobile drawer component
├── TransparentHeader.tsx          # Desktop header
├── ConversionButtons.tsx          # Reusable conversion buttons
└── analytics/
    └── ConversionTracking.tsx     # Tracking wrapper
```

## Technical Implementation

### Prisma Schema Updates

```prisma
enum EventType {
  visit
  book_now_clicked
  phone_clicked
  email_clicked
  social_media_clicked
  product_referral_clicked
  blog_post_clicked
  external_link_clicked
}

model MetricsEvent {
  id         String    @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt  DateTime  @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  eventType  EventType @map("event_type")  // Changed from String to enum
  url        String
  pathname   String
  userAgent  String?   @map("user_agent")
  referrer   String?
  eventData  Json?     @map("event_data")

  @@index([eventType])
  @@index([pathname])
  @@index([createdAt])
  @@map("metrics_events")
}
```

### Event Tracking Examples

```typescript
// Book Now button
<button
  onClick={() => {
    trackClick({
      eventType: 'book_now_clicked',
      location: 'mobile_drawer',
      destination: 'zocdoc'
    });
    window.location.href = ZOCDOC_URL;
  }}
>
  Book Now
</button>

// Phone button
<a
  href="tel:+12122280950"
  onClick={() => trackClick({
    eventType: 'phone_clicked',
    location: 'mobile_drawer'
  })}
>
  Call Now
</a>
```
