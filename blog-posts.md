In today's digital world, we're constantly exposed to blue light from our phones, computers, and tablets. But what exactly is blue light, and should you be concerned?

### What is Blue Light?

Blue light is a high-energy visible light that's emitted by the sun and digital devices. While some blue light exposure is natural and even beneficial during the day, excessive exposure—especially at night—can cause problems.

### Common Symptoms of Blue Light Exposure

- Eye strain and fatigue
- Dry eyes
- Headaches
- Difficulty sleeping
- Blurred vision

### How to Protect Your Eyes

**Use the 20-20-20 Rule:** Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

**Adjust Your Screen:** Position your screen 20-26 inches from your eyes and slightly below eye level.

**Consider Blue Light Glasses:** Special lenses can filter out harmful blue light while you work.

**Use Night Mode:** Enable night shift or blue light filters on your devices, especially in the evening.

### When to See an Optometrist

If you're experiencing persistent eye strain, headaches, or vision problems, schedule an appointment. We can recommend the best solutions for your specific needs.

Wearing contact lenses can be convenient and comfortable, but only if you take proper care of them. Here are the essential do's and don'ts of contact lens care.

### Daily Care Essentials

**Always wash your hands** before handling your contacts. Use soap and water, then dry with a lint-free towel.

**Use fresh solution every time.** Never top off old solution in your case—this can lead to contamination.

**Replace your case regularly.** Get a new case every 3 months to prevent bacterial buildup.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Never sleep in your contacts** unless they're specifically designed for overnight wear. This drastically increases your risk of eye infections.

**Don't use water or saliva** to clean or store your lenses. Only use sterile contact lens solution.

**Don't wear contacts while swimming or showering.** Water can introduce harmful bacteria to your eyes.

### Warning Signs

Remove your contacts immediately and contact your optometrist if you experience:

- Redness or irritation
- Pain or discomfort
- Excessive tearing
- Sensitivity to light
- Blurred vision

### Replacement Schedule

Follow your prescribed replacement schedule:
- Daily disposables: Replace every day
- Bi-weekly lenses: Replace every 2 weeks
- Monthly lenses: Replace monthly

**Remember:** When in doubt, throw it out. Your eye health is worth more than the cost of a new pair of contacts.
